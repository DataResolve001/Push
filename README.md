# DataResolve

**Business Intelligence App Powered by Motha's Second Law of Probability**

DataResolve helps businesses make smarter decisions using advanced forecasting models, customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis, and staff planning tools. This prototype uses real sales data to offer insights through a clean API and UI.

---

## Features

- Upload daily sales data (CSV)
- 7-day sales forecasting using **Motha's Second Law of Probability**
- Estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Detect busy days for part-time staff planning
- JSON API responses
- Built with **FastAPI** and ready for frontend integration

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- Pandas
- Uvicorn
- NumPy

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dataresolve.git
cd dataresolve

2. Create Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

> If requirements.txt is missing, run:



pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy

4. Run the API Server

uvicorn dataresolve:app --reload

Visit the API docs at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
